# Inquisitor investigations

Inquisitor’s investigations is an archive of findings based in the fantasy future world of the Warhammer 40,000 universe where the information can be stored and reviewed. Within the many horrors of the distant future the inquisition are the highest order of policing protecting all of humanity from threats within and outside of the empire of mankind.

The purpose of the site is to share the information across the universe to know the final outcome of the investigation and also for further issues to be logged. A way of agents and citizens being able to submit concerns and completed investigations to instil confidence that work is being done.

#Features

##Style
Warhammer is built on a neo gothic style which I have tried to emulate with a more classic design format.
The primary font colours are dark green background with a pale green font which is often used in the existing material inspired by the retro computer test styling.
 


##Intro page
The first page is a simple entry point sealed with an imperial crest simple start point designed to pass over that feeling of authority. 
##Navigation bar/footer
The navigation bar is present on all pages except the intro page it gives the options to move to the recent investigations to discover the outcomes, go straight to the new submissions form or return to the home page.
In order to standout against the predominant green text I used sharper colour contrast pattern of black, white and red.
 


##Home page
The home page has a fan generated video giving a summary of the fantasy universe told from the perspective of one of its soldiers giving entry point information for those unfamiliar and a more immersive experience to established fan base.
There is also a short about section in here it summarises the content of the video but also goes on to explain more of the content within the site.

##Investigations 
Here there are several panels each one is for a separate investigation and outcome. Currently only 1 is active the others are “redacted” but added for quicker expansion when needed.
The investigation sheet is set out to show what concerns were logged and what the outcome of the research. 

##Submissions 
This form is set to capture concerns of citizens. The data captures are simple requesting:
•	Name – basic capture to know who submitted the request.
•	Email address – to respond once checks complete.
•	Citizen rank – used to prioritise requests senior members take providence those who lie about their rank will be subject to review themselves. 
•	Summary box – small text box to list a brief overview of concerns to decided if review is necessary.
 

#Testing

Files run through validator.w3.org for html checks and www.cssportal.com. Errors found on most pages due to multiple duplicate ID’s this was intentionally set as they are all individual items so was not corrected as has no impact on functionality.	
There were also some functionality warnings regarding measurements used for some media content but these are unchanged as are necessary for current format.
