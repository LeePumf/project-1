            <p>Little is known of the beginnings of this chapter of marines until recently they were rarely mentioned at all and were largely believed to have been lost apart from very rare sightings.</p> <br>
            
            <p>They have no recorded home world and instead recruit from any imperial world willing to donate to their numbers where they are trained an inducted to the ranks aboard their flagship named "Enlightenment" an ancient Lunar classed battleship.  </p><br>
            
            <p>These recruitments are where the first reported issues have arisen to warrant this investigation as recent reports suggest that citizens are strong armed into joining the legion forces taking thousands at a time despite having incredibly low numbers of recorded active fighters. As we have no record of their gene seed this low conversion rate suspicionâ€™s are this is due to a volatile mutation within the chapter gene seed which has been kept hidden which would also explain the reason they have kept such distance from the imperial core worlds so as not to be detected sooner.</p><br>
            
            <p>Though this method is considered barbaric in the more developed core of the imperial systems its within the astartes rights to draft citizens as needed as long as the world is unclaimed by other astartes chapters. This dated rule is still valid and nessaceray to to insure the chapter can remain active in its duty.</p><br>

        <h2 class="title">Combat style</h2>
        
        <div>
            <p>They have a very distinct hammer and anvile style of warfare. Operate in 2 distinct wings the first usually deployed a clandestine shadow force that infiltrates to cause disruption and weaken enemys from within striking down key targets and command figures destoying the enemies morale and will to fight often even before they even know they are under attack. The 2nd wing is a heavy armoured divisions boasting large numbers of dreadnaughts, heavy weaponed tanks and thick plated centurians bearing down devastation shells and firepower unpon their already worn down enemys. </p><br>
            
            <p>It's unclear if this style of warfare evolved due to their low troop count or they maintain a smaller force as that is all thats required but they have proven very efficient.  </p><br>
            
            <p>We have already mentioned their flag ship "Enlightenment" but they actually travel in a reasonably large fleet mixed of both ancient and more modern ships some seem to bare marks of other imperial forces burnt off or removed. How they came into possession of these ships is vague each with basic accounts filed around discovering them as salvage but omitting many details around discovery and condition when rescued. Many Believe (mostly the forge masters of Mars) that the Harbingers pirate these ships from weakened imperial forces as no logs are registered of them being collected from any imperial shipyards. Theres also no records of them stopping to re-arm or repair their ships which also adds to this concern. It has been noted that some of the fleet bear marks consistent with chaos corruption however there are no reports leading us to believe the chapter has fallen to the great enemy but may suggest they are taking ships from the accursed enemy. </p> </asside>

        <h2 class="title">Investigation findings</h2>
        <p>Though little is known of the operations of the chapter what has been found is not enough to warrant imperial action at this time. The recruitment style though brutal at times is within their remit and nothing seen suggest that ships and munitions acquired are anything other than salvage.
            As there are no signs of corruption and all their actions show staunch loyalty to the emperor and imperium of mankind the investigation will be closed, however a tag will be placed within monitoring systems to continue monitoring the chapters actions should it appear to escalate then further actions can be taken. </p>
